# Roadmap Done

## [001] Fix video card title truncation / ellipsis overflow

**Status:** `done`
**Mode:** `Auto`
**Depends On:** none

### Goal

Video card titles no longer get cut off awkwardly. The line clamp and reserved height behave consistently across all cards.

### Scope

- Reconcile the title clamp with its reserved min-height so titles end cleanly with an ellipsis
- Apply the fix to both feed pages, ideally by extracting the duplicated card markup into a single shared component

### Technical Notes

- Title markup is inline (no shared component) and duplicated in `resources/js/pages/Groups/Show.vue:354` and `resources/js/pages/Videos/Feed.vue:277`
- Current classes: `line-clamp-2 min-h-9 text-[13px] leading-[1.35]`. Note the title clamps to **two** lines, not three; the awkward cut comes from `line-clamp-2` fighting the `min-h-9` reserved height and the `leading-[1.35]` line height
- Extracting the card into one component would let the fix live in a single place

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A title exceeding 2 lines renders exactly 2 lines terminated by an ellipsis, with no third-line text or descender clipping visible
- [x] Cards in the same row have identical rendered height (±0px) whether their title is 1 or 2 lines
- [x] The title clamp value and reserved min-height are defined in exactly one place (shared component), and both `Groups/Show.vue` and `Videos/Feed.vue` render titles through it

## [002] Persist loaded videos across group/tab switches

**Status:** `done`
**Mode:** `Auto`
**Depends On:** none

### Goal

After clicking "Load more", switching to another group and returning keeps the extra loaded videos and expand state instead of resetting to page one.

### Scope

- Cache loaded videos + pagination cursor + older-expanded state per group
- Rehydrate that state on return instead of blindly replacing it
- Apply the same fix to the infinite-scroll feed variant

### Technical Notes

- Root cause: loaded videos live only in component-local `reactive` state (`items`, `nextUrl`, `olderExpanded` in `resources/js/pages/Groups/Show.vue:43-47`), and `videos` is an `Inertia::defer` prop (`app/Http/Controllers/GroupFeedController.php:23`, `app/Http/Controllers/AllVideosFeedController.php:25`)
- Sidebar "tabs" are full Inertia `<Link>` navigations (`resources/js/components/NavGroupFeeds.vue`), so returning re-instantiates the page; the `watch(() => props.videos, ...)` at `Show.vue:49-62` splices `items` back to page one
- `loadMore` (`Show.vue:99-121`) appends via a manual partial fetch that is never stored in props or a store, so it is lost on navigation
- Recommended direction: cache `items` + `nextUrl` + `olderExpanded` per group id (Pinia store or `sessionStorage`) and rehydrate in the watcher; apply the same to `Feed.vue`'s infinite-scroll variant

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Loading more to N videos (N > page size), switching to another group, and returning shows the same N videos, in the same order, without a re-fetch to page one
- [x] On return, the `nextUrl` cursor resumes from where it left off (the next "Load more" fetches page N+1, not page 2) and `olderExpanded` matches its pre-navigation value
- [x] Both `Groups/Show.vue` and `Videos/Feed.vue` pass this same round-trip check

## [003] Audit available RSS feed fields

**Status:** `done`
**Mode:** `Auto`
**Depends On:** none

### Goal

Document every field YouTube's channel RSS feed exposes and which the app currently uses, to inform the video-cap and popularity work.

### Scope

- Inventory all feed-level and per-entry fields
- Record which fields are ingested today vs available but unused
- Note whether a usable popularity signal exists

### Technical Notes

- Parsing happens in `app/Services/RssFetcher.php::ingest()` (`simplexml_load_string`, `yt` and `media` namespaces)
- Findings written to `RSS_FEED_AUDIT.md` at the project root
- Key result: the feed provides `media:community/media:statistics @views` and `media:starRating` (average, count) plus `media:description`, `updated`, and author info. None of these are stored today; only `yt:videoId`, `title`, `published`, and one `media:thumbnail` URL are ingested
- There is a usable popularity signal (views + star rating), but only as a point-in-time snapshot at fetch, not a historical trend

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `RSS_FEED_AUDIT.md` exists at project root listing all feed fields
- [x] Current usage vs unused fields documented
- [x] Popularity availability noted

## [004] Video count cap MVP — latest unwatched only

**Status:** `done`
**Mode:** `Auto`
**Depends On:** `[003]`

### Goal

A toggleable mode that shows only the latest unwatched video per channel. Marking it watched does not hide it, but reveals the next available unwatched video from that channel.

### Scope

- Per-user toggle for the cap mode
- Per-channel logic that surfaces the newest not-watched video
- Marking watched reveals that channel's next unwatched video
- Already-watched videos still render per existing behavior

### Technical Notes

- Effectively a per-channel cap of 1 on *unwatched* videos
- Watched state lives in `user_video_states` (`state` enum watched/hidden, keyed by `youtube_video_id`; written by `app/Http/Controllers/VideoStateController.php`)
- Feed queries in `GroupFeedController` / `AllVideosFeedController` order by `published_at DESC, id DESC` and join `user_video_states`
- Decide whether the cap is enforced server-side in the paginated query (a per-channel window, e.g. `ROW_NUMBER`) or client-side over loaded `items`. Server-side is cleaner with cursor pagination

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The toggle persists per user and its state survives a page reload
- [x] With the cap on, the feed contains at most one unwatched video per channel (the newest by `published_at`); a channel with zero unwatched videos contributes none
- [x] Marking that video watched removes it and surfaces exactly that channel's next-newest unwatched video (or none if the channel has no more), leaving other channels unchanged
- [x] Toggling off returns the feed to the full unfiltered list (same count and order as with the cap disabled)

## [005] Editable per-subscription unwatched video cap

**Status:** `done`
**Mode:** `Auto`
**Depends On:** `[004]`

### Goal

Let the user set the max number of unwatched videos shown per subscription (e.g. 2, 5, unlimited), editable per channel, generalizing the MVP's cap-of-1.

### Scope

- Configurable integer cap per subscription with a sensible default and an unlimited option
- UI to edit the value per channel
- Feed respects each channel's cap

### Technical Notes

- Extends `[004]` from a fixed cap of 1 to a configurable integer
- Storage: a nullable `unwatched_cap` per subscription, likely on `user_channel_favorites` or a new per-user-per-channel settings row. Note no dedicated model exists for `user_channel_favorites` today; it is used via raw joins in controllers
- Reuse the `[004]` per-channel windowing, parameterized by the cap
- Optional: expose the popularity signal from `[003]` (views / star rating) as an alternate ordering within the cap ("show top N by views" vs "latest N"), noting it is a fetch-time snapshot

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Each subscription stores an `unwatched_cap` that persists across reloads; setting it to a value M limits that channel to at most M unwatched videos in the feed
- [x] The feed enforces per-channel caps simultaneously: with caps of 2 and 5 on two channels, the feed shows at most 2 and at most 5 unwatched videos from them respectively
- [x] A new subscription starts at the documented default cap without manual configuration, and an "unlimited" setting removes the cap entirely (all unwatched videos show)
- [x] The per-channel cap is editable from the UI and the changed value takes effect on the next feed render without a full reload
